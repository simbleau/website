# Icons
For icons, I build subsets of [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) free version. See [https://github.com/simbleau/fontsubset](https://github.com/simbleau/fontsubset) for more information on the process. FontAwesome fonts fall under the [SIL OFL License, Version 1.1](SIL OFL)

# Roboto
Currently, I use Roboto as my website font. This is a Google font under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
